# MIPS-algortihm
DESCRIPTION OF ALGORITHM 
# Used an array where the number of instructions would be needed 

# for a certain instruction to not be considered a dependency. 

# Each instruction had an assigned value and with each passing 

# instruction that value would be decremeted but 1 till it was 0. 

# When the value is 0 that means the instruction can pass the needed 

# value through forwarding.
